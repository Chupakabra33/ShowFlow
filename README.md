This is my final course project on the web development education course for beginners.
Time for development: 3 month, working only during weekends.
Technologies, libraries and programming languages used:
  HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, AngularJS, Ajax, PHP, SQL, PHPMailer
and
  XAMPP, Apache, MySQL

The website represents (the beginning) of an online platform for booking events of almost any type, although for now it only presents the events without the booking and ticket purchase ability, because my knowlege is still basic. The website has a full responsive design suitable for even the smallest divices.
There are a few pages to explore:
  - Home
  - Events
  - Contacts
  - Register

The events are stored in database and are exracted and displayed by using AngularJS.
The images are stored in my computer (that woud be the server one day) and only the path to the images is stored within the database.
The contact form uses PHPMailer in order to send real messages (on my personal mail so far).
Both the contact form the login form and the register form have validation via PHP and well working error handlers.
So far there are over 20 regestered users (by me) and all of them have the name "Test..." just to make sure the validation is fine.
I haven't uploaded the images and the database files because I suppose no one would download it to explore it on their localhost.
Well that's it in short. Have fun! ...and don't steal it please.
